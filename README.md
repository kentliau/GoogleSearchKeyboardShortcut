Keyboard Shortcuts for Google Search
====================================
Google removed the keyboard shortcut in search, there are available extensions in the extension store that give you this functionality back, but they request extraneous permission or use unnecessary third party javascript libraries. This version of mine use no third party libraries nor request unnecessary permission to work. [Just plain vanilla javascript](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/).


Shortcut Key
============

* `/`: Focus search box
* `j`: Select next result or next/previous page
* `k`: Select previous result or next/previous page


Installation
============
